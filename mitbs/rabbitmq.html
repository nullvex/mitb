To create a thread that listens for messages from a RabbitMQ queue, we can use the `threading` module in Python. This thread will continuously check for messages from the RabbitMQ queue, process them, and then go back to listening. Here’s how we can set it up.

### Step 1: Message Consumer Class with Threading

We'll create a `RabbitMQConsumer` class that connects to RabbitMQ, listens for messages, and processes them in a dedicated thread.

```python
import pika
import threading
import time

class RabbitMQConsumer(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', queue='default_queue'):
        super().__init__()
        self.host = host
        self.queue = queue
        self.connection = None
        self.channel = None
        self.stop_event = threading.Event()  # Event to stop the thread

    def connect(self):
        """Connect to RabbitMQ server and declare queue."""
        self.connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(self.host))
        self.channel = self.connection.channel()
        self.channel.queue_declare(queue=self.queue)
        print(f"Connected to RabbitMQ on queue '{self.queue}'")

    def run(self):
        """Start the consumer thread."""
        self.connect()
        while not self.stop_event.is_set():
            method_frame, header_frame, body = self.channel.basic_get(self.queue, auto_ack=True)
            if method_frame:
                print(f"Received message: {body}")
                self.process_message(body)
            else:
                time.sleep(1)  # Wait before checking again if no message found

        # Clean up
        self.connection.close()
        print("Consumer thread stopped")

    def process_message(self, message):
        """Process incoming message (customizable based on application needs)."""
        print(f"Processing message: {message}")

    def stop(self):
        """Stop the consumer thread."""
        self.stop_event.set()
```

### Step 2: Producer Class to Send Messages

Next, we’ll create a simple `RabbitMQProducer` class to send messages to RabbitMQ, so we have something for the consumer to process.

```python
class RabbitMQProducer:
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', queue='default_queue'):
        self.host = host
        self.queue = queue
        self.connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host))
        self.channel = self.connection.channel()
        self.channel.queue_declare(queue=queue)

    def publish(self, message):
        """Publish a message to the queue."""
        self.channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key=self.queue, body=message)
        print(f"Sent message: {message}")

    def close(self):
        """Close the connection."""
        self.connection.close()
```

### Step 3: Run and Test the Code

Here's an example of how you can start the consumer thread, send some messages, and stop the consumer when done.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize producer and consumer
    producer = RabbitMQProducer(queue='test_queue')
    consumer = RabbitMQConsumer(queue='test_queue')
    
    # Start consumer thread
    consumer.start()
    
    # Send some test messages
    for i in range(5):
        producer.publish(f"Test message {i}")
        time.sleep(0.5)

    # Allow some time for messages to be processed
    time.sleep(5)

    # Stop the consumer and close producer connection
    consumer.stop()
    consumer.join()  # Wait for the consumer thread to finish
    producer.close()
```

### Explanation of Code

- **RabbitMQConsumer**: This class extends `threading.Thread`, making it run as a separate thread. It connects to RabbitMQ and continuously listens for messages.
- **process_message**: This method processes the received message (here, it simply prints it).
- **stop**: This method sets an event that causes the thread to exit its main loop and stop.
- **RabbitMQProducer**: This simple producer class sends messages to the queue.

### Expected Output

When you run the code, you should see messages being sent by the producer and received by the consumer. The output would look something like this:

```
Connected to RabbitMQ on queue 'test_queue'
Sent message: Test message 0
Received message: Test message 0
Processing message: Test message 0
...
Consumer thread stopped
``` 

This example shows how RabbitMQ can be integrated with Python and managed through threaded message consumption.
